       description: `I’m Aniket Mallick, a passionate Software Engineer and M.Tech. graduate in ECE from NIT Raipur (2025)   with a strong focus on building intelligent and scalable web applications.\n
        At ITJOBXS, I engineered high-performance systems — from a responsive eCommerce platform to an advanced bot-detection system — boosting user engagement by 30% and reducing spam registrations by 70%.\n
        Recently, I developed Atlas – a ChatGPT Clone, a full-stack generative AI platform capable of handling 500+ requests per hour, powered by RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and real-time chat with Socket.io.\n
        With expertise in React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, and solid problem-solving skills (600+ coding challenges solved, Top 10% at Bhilai Hacks 2023), I strive to design solutions that are not only functional but also impactful and efficient.\n
        Explore my projects like MovieVerse, Shortest Path Visualizer, and Atlas to see how I turn complex ideas into smooth, scalable digital experiences.`,
